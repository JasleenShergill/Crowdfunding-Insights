# ðŸš€ Data Venture: Unveiling Crowdfunding Insights ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Crowdfunding ETL project! In this collaborative endeavor, we'll harness the power of Python, Pandas, and database management to extract, transform, and load crowdfunding data into a PostgreSQL database. ðŸŒŸ

**Project Overview:**
In this mini project, we'll be working together to build an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. Our goal is to extract data from Excel files, transform it into structured formats, and then load it into a PostgreSQL database. By doing so, we'll create valuable insights for further analysis.

**Project Structure:**

**ETL_Mini_Project_NRomanoff_JSmith.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the collaborative work on the ETL pipeline.  
**Resources/:** Folder containing the source Excel files (crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx).  
**category.csv:** CSV file containing category data.  
**subcategory.csv**: CSV file containing subcategory data.  
**campaign.csv:** CSV file containing campaign data.  
**contacts.csv:** CSV file containing contact data.  
**crowdfunding_db_schema.sql:** SQL file containing the schema for the PostgreSQL database.  

**Collaboration and Support:**
Together, let's ignite the spark of discovery and illuminate the path to insights! ðŸ’¡âœ¨
